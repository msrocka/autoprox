# autoprox
For a process `p` in a database with a set of background processes `Q`,
`autoprox` generates a set of bridge processes `B` as described in
[Ingwersen et al. 2018](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6463304/)
that connect the product inputs and waste outputs of `p` with corresponding
product outputs and waste inputs provided by the processes in `Q`.
